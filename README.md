Artificial intelligence - Hand-on AI and ML with Python

## 1. env setup instruction

1.1 create your own project folder inside this repositories as for example I do interesting and experimenting in Quant trading and integrated with AI and ML so I create folder name as "kholed-langsari_ai-quant-finance" <br>
1.2 respect project folder structure https://github.com/drivendataorg/cookiecutter-data-science

## 2. project instruction

Respect/follow AI/ML/DS process as 6 steps CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)CRISP-DM or 5 steps Team Data Science Process (TDSP) or 8 steps of the model End-to-End Machine Learning Project as below:<br><br>
2.1 Look at the big picture.<br>
2.2 Get the data.<br>
2.3 Explore and visualize the data to gain insights.<br>
2.4 Prepare the data for machine learning algorithms. <br>
2.5 Select a model and train it.<br>
2.6 Fine-tune your model.<br>
2.7 Present your solution.<br>
2.8 Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.<br>

## 3. project submition and presentation
3.1. submit project detail to the given GitHub (AI-FUN-2026) <br>
3.2. progress presentataion <br>
3.3. final presentataion <br>


# AI-FUN-2026
Artificial Intelligence - Hands-On AI and ML with Python project

## 1. Environment Setup Instructions

1.1. Create your project folder: Create your own project folder inside this repository. For example, since my focus is on experimenting with quantitative trading integrated with AI and ML, I named my folder kholed-langsari_ai-quant-finance.<br>
1.2. Standardize the folder structure: Please adhere to a standard data science project directory structure. We recommend using the [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cookiecutter-data-science) framework.<br>

## 2. Project Instructions

Please follow a standard AI/ML/DS lifecycle for your project. You may choose the 6-step CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), the 5-step Team Data Science Process (TDSP), or follow the standard 8-step End-to-End Machine Learning workflow outlined below:

2.1. Look at the big picture.<br>
2.2. Get the data.<br>
2.3. Explore and visualize the data to gain insights.<br>
2.4. Prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.<br>
2.5. Select a model and train it.<br>
2.6. Fine-tune your model.<br>
2.7. Present your solution.<br>
2.8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.<br>

## 3. Project Submission and Presentation

3.1. Repository Submission: Submit your project details, code, and documentation to the designated GitHub repository (AI-FUN-2026).<br>
3.2. Progress Presentation: Be prepared to present a mid-point status update on your workflow and preliminary findings.<br>
3.3. Final Presentation: Deliver a comprehensive final presentation covering your end-to-end methodology, model evaluation, and final solution.<br>
